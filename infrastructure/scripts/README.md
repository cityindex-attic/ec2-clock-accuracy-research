# Scripts to support Amazon EC2 clock accuracy research

This folder gathers various scripts used within this project currently. 
The goal is to provide a starting point for anyone who wants to reproduce this piece of research.

* NOTE: This folder used to also contain a set of [boto](https://github.com/boto/boto) extensions and command line scripts to support 
cross region usage - these have been extracted to [botocross](https://github.com/sopel/botocross).

Scripts can be implemented in any language, though currently the team focuses on either 
Python with boto or PowerShell with the AWS SDK for .NET for its AWS automation tasks.
