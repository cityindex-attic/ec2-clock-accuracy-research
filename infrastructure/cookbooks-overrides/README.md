`cookbooks-overrides` directory is used to store simple, file-specific overrides to otherwise established and stable external cookbooks from the community site or github. (It essentially bypasses Librarian management for simple customizations, pulling in overrides at the Chef/Knife level by using the secondary reference in the [`cookbook_path` setting of `knife.rb`](https://github.com/mrdavidlaing/pressupbox/tree/master/.chef/knife.rb#L16).) This is most appropriate for less complex changes to files and additions of any new files (recipes, templates, files, etc.). We'll need to carefully scrutinize these files when updating corresponding cookbooks in `Cheffile.lock`. If overrides are extensive, it may make sense to fork the external cookbook and pull in our own, but this should be avoided where possible.
